Topic: Network Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models
Abstract:
Deep learning algorithms have shown promise in speech recognition, picture processing, natural language processing, and a wide range of other fields.System administrators can use a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) to detect network security breaches in their businesses.Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are critical tools for network managers to detect various security breaches within a company's network. NIDS monitors and analyzes network traffic entering and exiting an organization's network devices, and raises alarms if an intrusion is detected. Our solution helps detect the two types of networks which intrude the system, these are normal and abnormal attacks on a computer. The dataset we have used is the NSL-KDD dataset which contains 43 classes and close to 126000 samples. This paper talks about 5 different models. The final model is built using a deep learning approach which has an detection rate of 99.04%.

How to Run:

Google collab or Jupyter Notebook can be used to run our code with the datset provided in the repository.
